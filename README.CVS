This is the development tree.  It is for developers.  It is not for users. 
It is not stable.  It likely won't compile.  Don't moan if doesn't work
(send patches, by all means, just don't moan :)  The latest release that's
intended for users is always available from http://sf.net/projects/jack-rack.
