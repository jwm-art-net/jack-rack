1.4.6:
* Updated fr_FR translation (patch from Raphaël Doursenaud).
* Don't rely on being able to set and use the default gettext domain;
  some buggy LADSPA plugins clobber it (reported by Raphaël Doursenaud).
* Always install pixmaps and the application file into the installation
  prefix.
* Mark many more messages for translation.
* Put the user-visible copyright messages in a central place.
* Allow effects to be toggled on and off by MIDI (patch from Scott
  Davidson).
* Add de_DE translation (patch from Sebastian Arnold).
* Assign default control values to the correct controls (reported by Tim
  Goetze).
* Experimental support for 14-bit MIDI control messages (suggested by
  Florent Berthaut).
* Allow the range of values that MIDI controls cover to be chosen (patch
  from Dmitry Baikov).


1.4.5:
* JACK connection loss now employs automatic reconnect
* widgets controlled via MIDI now get all their channels updated
* added french translation
* applied patch from Mark Vitek that supports the latest LASH API changes
* corrected MIDI controller numbering (reported by James Stone)
* internal: introduced flexible status and error handlers
* (now maintained by Adam Sampson)
* Various cleanups to the source code.
* Use the new GTK about dialog and toolbar APIs (the major effect of
  which is that the "add" button in the toolbar now looks different).
* Use the correct dialogs when opening and saving files.
* Disconnect safely from JACK upon shutdown (patch from Florian Paul
  Schmidt).
* Make the configure script check for the LADSPA header.
* Fix LASH support (reported by Brian Dunn).



1.4.4:
* user may specify a rack file to be loaded at startup now
* removed references to jack_set_server_dir


1.4.3:

* updated for ladcca 0.4.0


1.4.2:

* fixed some segfaults
* fixed some bad configure script checks
* i18n support and Russian translation, courtesy of Alexey Voinov and
  Alexandre Prokoudine

1.4.1:

* icon and .desktop get installed properly
* much more graceful handling of jackd shutdowns
* midi thread will now try and use SCHED_FIFO.  If you run jackd with
  jackstart then you don't need to do anything to enable this as jackd will
  give the appropriate rights to jack rack.


1.4.0:

* MIDI support


1.3.0:

* you can now use plugins with unequal numbers of input and output ports. 
  any excess ports get exposed as extra jack ports with names like
  "amplif_1-1_i2", of the form 
  "<shortened plugin name>_<rack position>-<plugin copy>_{i,o}<port>"
* wet/dry controls for the output of each plugin
* logarithmic controls
* much more resilient file loader


1.2.0:

* can now have arbitrary channel numbers.  you can use any plugin that has
  equal numbers of input and output channels where they divide exactly into
  the number of rack channels.  eg, you could have a 4 channel rack with 2
  stereo plugins in one slot and 4 mono plugins in another.  obviously, you
  can also have mono racks now.  use the -c command line option to specify
  the number of channels on startup.
* now, when you lock a group of controls, only one widget will be shown.
  click on a control while holding down the CTRL key to make it the one that
  remains visible.
* the PID is now used in the jack client name by default.  you can change it
  to the previous behaviour (of using just "jack_rack") with the -n option.
* save files now use an XML format (which is incompatible with the previous
  format, sorry)
* port connecting works now, -i to connect inputs, -o to connect outputs
* quite a bit of code factoring and cleanups and stuff


1.1.2:

* build fixes for gcc 2.9x from Fernando Pablo Lopez-Lezcano
* compiles with gtk 2.0 now (thanks to Fernando again)
* builds without lrdf now (thanks to Austin Acton)


1.1.1:

* fixed control output ports segfault
* fixed desktop installation prefix stuff
* fixed dealing with duplicate plugin ids
* now quits when you close the window
* added a "New" option to clear the rack
* rack is now automatically cleared when you load a file


1.1:

* proper ladcca support (pays attention to events)
* added saving/loading rack configurations.  this is a bit of a hack tho as
  when you open a file, it only adds the plugins to whatever's in the
  current rack.  in fact, the whole of the file loading/saving is hairy atm.
* added lrdf support (this is majorly phat.. categorised plugin menus :)
* proper toolbar with stock buttons
* added a menu bar
* added a splash screen
* added an about box (using gnome 2)
* nice new icon and logo images, used for the splash screen, the window
  icons and also a gnome 2 .desktop
* lots of code separation and cleanups and under-the-hood changes
* control rows now have no central port label


1.0.1:

* jack_set_server_dir is optional
* LADCCA support
* fixed bug dealing with LADSPA_PATH


1.0:

* initial public release
